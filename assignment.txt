The main goal of this test assignment is to implement a simple recorder/player of camera movement trajectory.

Prerequisites:

* A camera that is always looking at some target object (a simple cube).
* That camera could rotate around this cube at a constant radius in all directions (on the surface of an imaginary sphere).

You should create a simple UI with the possibility to:

* Rotate that camera by finger/mouse.
* Record camera movement trajectory.
* Preview/Play recorded camera trajectory.

Would be a plus, but not necessary:

* Save this recording persistently.
* Save multiple recordings.
* Load and play recorded camera movement in a separate scene.
* Show recorded trajectory in the Editor using gismos.

We recommend using default Unity UI and packages for this task, though any open-source plugins or enhancements are allowed.
